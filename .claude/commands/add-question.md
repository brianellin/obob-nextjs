Guide me through adding a new question to questions.json:

1. Show me the structure of an existing question
2. Ask me for the question details:
   - Question type (content or in-which-book)
   - Question text
   - Book key
   - Page number
   - Answer (if content question)
   - Source/contributor (optional)
3. Validate the question data
4. Add it to questions.json
5. Run the generate-exports script to update metadata
