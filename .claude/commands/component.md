description: Create a new React component following project conventions
---

Help me create a new React component:

1. Ask for the component name and purpose
2. Determine if it should be a Server or Client Component
3. Create the component file in the appropriate location:
   - Feature components go in /components
   - UI primitives go in /components/ui
4. Follow these conventions:
   - Use TypeScript with proper typing
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Import types from @/types
   - Use cn() utility for conditional classes
   - Add JSDoc comments for complex components
5. Create the component with proper exports
6. Provide usage examples
