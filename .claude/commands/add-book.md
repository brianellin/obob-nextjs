Guide me through adding a new book to the OBOB app:

1. Show me the structure of existing books in lib/books.ts
2. Ask me for the book details:
   - Title
   - Author
   - Division (3-5, 6-8, or 9-12)
   - Year (2024-2025)
   - Cover image filename
   - Author pronunciation (optional)
3. Generate a book_key from the title
4. Add the book to lib/books.ts
5. Remind me to add the cover image to /public directory
6. Update types if necessary
