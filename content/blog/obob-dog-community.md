You can contribute questions to [OBOB.dog](https://OBOB.dog) and make it better for everyone. Here's how:

1. Grab the OBOB book you are currently reading.

2. Go to [obob.dog/books](https://obob.dog/books) and find your book based on the year/division. Click the "View questions" button.

3. Navigate to the page you want to add a question for and click the "Add question" button. You'll be presented with a form like this:

4. Select your question type, either Content or In Which Book.

- If you're submitting a Content question, keep the answer short and sweet. One or two words that that can be evaluated objectively - nothing left open to interpretation.
- For In Which Book questions, don't repeat the "In which book" text, we'll handle that for ya.

5. Provide your name and email (or parent's email), so we can let you know when the question is posted.

6. Volunteers will review the questions and add them to the 'dog.

7. Repeat as you read!

That's it! Here's a few more tips to follow:

- Be unique - don't duplicate the content of questions that have already been posted. Look below the form at the list of questions that are already cited for the page.
- Increase coverage - some books don't have many questions, or have large sections without any questions at all. Try adding some questions that increase the coverage in those areas. For example, if a page already has 10 questions, try finding a page with 0 questions and submit some for that page.

Questions contributed from the form will be part of the "OBOB.dog Community" source:
