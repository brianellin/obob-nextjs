Today we're excited to share a new game that we're calling **The Daily Crossword**!  It's like an OBOB version of a crossword that you'd find in a paper newspaper, but you can solve it together with your friends in real-time. It looks like this:

Unlike the other games and battles on OBOB.dog, the crossword doesn't let you choose your own books. You'll have to work with your team or friends across all 16 books to solve the puzzle. 

## How it works
1. **New puzzle every day** — Each morning there's a fresh crossword for each division that uses content questions from all the books.
2. **Play together** — Create a team room and invite friends or teammates to solve it together in real-time. You'll see everyone on the screen at once and what they're working on. Only people you invite will join your team's crossword. 
3. **Live chat** — Use the optional built-in voice chat to strategize and chat with your friends in real time while you play (just click the audio icon)

Each clue is a content question from your division's OBOB books. When you fill in the correct answer, the clue gets marked as complete. Work together until you've solved them all!

## Collaboration is key 🔑 

You might notice that unlike the other battles and games on OBOB.DOG, the crossword doesn't let you select specific books and you must play with all 16. This is by design!

**The Daily Crossword is built for teamwork.** The puzzle includes questions from every book in your division, which means you'll need to phone a friend for help. Send them your team code / link, and ask them to answer the clues for the books they've read. It's okay to ask for help and collaboration is key! 

That's all for now. Go to [obob.dog/crossword](https://obob.dog/crossword) to give it a try. We'd love to know what you think and how we could make it better. Have more questions, check out the FAQ on the game page.
