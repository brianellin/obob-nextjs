We're excited to introduce a brand new way to practice OBOB: the **Daily Crossword**! Every day, there's a fresh crossword puzzle generated from OBOB content questions, and you can solve it together with your team in real-time.

## How it works

1. **Create or join a team** — Start by creating a new team (you'll get a fun code like "BARK-X7K2") or join an existing one by entering a friend's code.

2. **Invite your teammates** — Share the team code or link with friends, classmates, or family members. Anyone with the code can join your puzzle.

3. **Solve together in real-time** — As your teammates type answers, you'll see them appear on your screen instantly. No more waiting or taking turns!

Each clue is a content question from your division's OBOB books. When you fill in the correct answer, the clue gets marked as complete. Work together until you've solved them all!

## Why all 16 books?

You might notice that unlike our other practice modes, Daily Crossword doesn't let you select specific books. This is by design!

**The Daily Crossword is built for teamwork.** The puzzle includes questions from every book in your division, which means:

- **No one person needs to know everything.** Maybe your teammate read *one* book cover to cover while you focused on another. Together, you can cover more ground.

- **It encourages collaboration.** Stuck on a clue? Ask for help! There's even a built-in help feature that lets you share a specific clue with a teammate who might know the answer.

- **Everyone plays the same puzzle.** Since every team gets the same daily puzzle, you can compare your times with other teams and friends.

This is about bringing people together — teammates, siblings, parents, or friends — to practice OBOB as a group. When you hit a clue you don't know, that's your cue to call in reinforcements!
