**Zoomies** is a new game mode on OBOB.dog focused on "in which book" questions. It's designed to help kids practice recognizing which book a question refers to by showing book covers instead of titles.

## What is Zoomies?

Zoomies shows you an "in which book" question along with four book covers. Tap the correct cover before time runs out. You have 15 seconds per question and 15 questions per round.

## How to Play

1. **Select your division** from the OBOB.dog homepage
2. **Choose "Zoomies"** from the Games section
3. **Tap Play** to start with all 16 books, or choose specific books to focus on
4. **Answer 15 questions** — you have 15 seconds each
5. **See your results** at the end

Each question shows four book covers. Tap the one that matches the question. Faster correct answers earn more points.

## Streaks and Combos

Answer multiple questions correctly in a row to build a **streak**. Streaks unlock score multipliers:

- **5 correct in a row** = 2x multiplier
- **10 correct in a row** = 4x multiplier

You'll also see reaction messages pop up as you play — a mix of modern slang and retro throwbacks.

## Pack Ranks

At the end of each round, you earn a Pack Rank based on your accuracy:

- **TOP DOG** — 90%+ correct
- **VERY GOOD DOG** — 80%+ correct
- **GOOD DOGGG** — 65%+ correct
- **LEARNING NEW TRICKS** — 50%+ correct
- **OBOB PUPPY** — Still learning

## Focus on Specific Books

You can choose to practice with a subset of books instead of all 16. Tap "Choose your books" before starting to select which ones you want to include.

Playing with fewer books reduces your score multiplier (4 books = 0.25x, all 16 = 1.0x), but can be helpful for focused practice.

## Share Your Score

After finishing a round, you can share your results with friends. The share includes your Pack Rank, score, max streak, and a link to play.

## Tips

- **Learn the covers** — Spend time on the Books page looking at covers and titles together
- **Trust your first instinct** — With 15 seconds, there's not much time to overthink
- **Start focused** — If you're struggling, pick 4-6 books and practice those first
