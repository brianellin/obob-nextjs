title: "Feature Friday: Author Pronunciation!"

excerpt: "Tap an author's name to see the pronunciation"

A big part of OBOB is learning each author's name and being able to pronounce it correctly during a live battle. To help with some of the trickier ones, you can now tap an underlined author name to quickly view the pronunciation. For example:

And:

It's a small thing, but hopefully will help everyone learn the correct pronunciation as they play. Have a great weekend, and happy OBOBing!
