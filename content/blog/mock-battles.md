excerpt: "Moderate a real OBOB battle between two teams with automatic scoring and steals"

Hey y'all — one of the best ways to help kids prepare for real OBOB competition is to let them practice in a format that feels like the real thing. Based on what we've learned running practice battles at Glencoe, we built a new tool on OBOB.dog to make that easier. Mock Battles let parents, coaches, and even kids run full simulation battles anytime:

It uses all the same questions available to solo and friend battles, but follows more of the formal OBOB battle structure:

- Mock battles use all 16 books
- Mock battles are between two teams, and keep track of each team's points automatically
- Mock battles have optional steals! If a team answers a question incorrectly, the other team will have the opportunity to answer and steal their points.

You can also choose a Regular battle or a Mini battle:

- Regular battles are regulation length: 16 total questions, 8 per team
- Mini battles are shorter: 8 total questions, 4 per team. Think of it as a lightning battle ⚡️, short and sweet.

We think mini battles may be useful for running a lot of mock battles with teams at school events under time constraints (like recess).

We are always trying to learn and grow while helping more kids fall in love with reading in the process. Let us know if you use the new battle mode and how it is working for your team!

Start a mock battle by visiting [OBOB.dog](https://obob.dog/), selecting your division, and clicking the "Mock battle" button at the bottom of the page. Woof!
