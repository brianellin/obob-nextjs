Last fall we built OBOB.dog as a simple tool for our Oregon Battle of the Books (OBOB) team at Glencoe Elementary to practice together without having to print out loads of PDFs or spreadsheets.

All the questions on OBOB.dog are written by community volunteers, and there are almost seven thousand questions already for the year.

You can now add questions to OBOB.dog and make it better for everyone!
